  <p class="text-base text-center">
    My name is Samra Anwar. <br> I am a physiotherapist in Lahore, Pakistan. I did my higher secondary at West Bengal council of higher secondary education as a science student. And after that, I completed my graduation in commerce from IGNOU
<br>
Currently, I am looking for a job at your company to upskill myself.
<br>
My strengths are flexibility, honesty and dedication.
<br>
My weaknesses are I am too much of a self-critic, sometimes I feel so insecure and I overthink too much.
<br>
My hobby is playing and watching football matches.
